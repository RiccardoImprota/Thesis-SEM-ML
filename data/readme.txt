In my local code repository, the subdirectories "source" and "processed" data are available within this directory. Due to legal constraints, I am unable to share this data on GitHub.

Should the reader possess the appropriate dataset, it can be inserted in the .sav format into the data/source, and subsequently, a data/processed/factordatasets folder can be created to accomodate all code.

For the code to function correctly, the manually curated files named var_to_reverse.csv, used_variables.csv, and EGAdimensions.csv are also essential. Regrettably, I cannot yet share them due to legal restrictions.
